## 2. OpenAPI/Swagger Specification File

This OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification defines the complete REST API for JuaJobs.The API provides comprehensive functionality for user management, job posting and discovery, application processing, and reviews.

The specification file includes 23 endpoints organized across five main resource categories: Users, Jobs, Applications, Reviews, and Authentication. It supports role-based access control with three user types (clients, freelancers, and administrators), implements *JWT-based authentication* with *Bearer tokens*, and provides detailed request/response schemas with validation rules.

Key features include **pagination** and **filtering** across list endpoints, comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and validation messages, and bidirectional relationships between core entities. The API is designed to support both *fixed-price* and *hourly-rate* projects, maintains user reputation through a 5-star rating/review system, and includes complete CRUD operations for all major resources.

The specification targets production deployment at ***api.juajobs.com/v1** with a staging environment available, and includes extensive documentation with request/response examples and detailed schema definitions for all data models.

**The Specification file can be found [here](phase_3/OpenAPI_file.yaml)**
