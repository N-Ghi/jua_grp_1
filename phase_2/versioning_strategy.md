### API Versioning Strategy
As the JuaJobs platform evolves, its API must support controlled change while minimizing disruption for existing users. A robust versioning and deprecation framework is critical.

## Versioning Approach
JuaJobs will adopt a URI-based versioning strategy for clarity and long-term support:

Format: https://api.juajobs.com/v1/

Easy to route, test, and cache

Version can be embedded in documentation and client SDKs

Supports parallel operation of multiple versions

## Deprecation Policy & Compatibility
JuaJobs will follow a graceful deprecation lifecycle for breaking changes:

| Stage |	Timeline |	Details |
|--------|---------|-----------|
|Announcement |	T - 90 days	| Blog post, changelog, and email to developers. |
|Sunset Header |	Introduced post-announcement |	Sunset: <deprecation-date> HTTP header |
|Deprecated |	T - 60 days |	Still operational but flagged in logs and responses. |
|Shutdown	| T - 0 days	| API version fully retired |

Backward-compatible changes (e.g., adding optional fields) will be allowed in minor updates without a new version.

## Change Management Framework
JuaJobs will maintain the following mechanisms for managing and communicating changes:

Changelog: Maintained on the developer portal.

Release Notes: Included with every major or minor version.

Testing Sandbox: Versioned environments for partners to test ahead of production.

Version Tags: Git-tagged releases for SDKs and API documentation.

## Feature Toggles & Capability Discovery
To support experimentation and gradual rollouts:

Feature Flags: Enable/disable features at runtime based on user role, region, or A/B testing groups.

Capability Discovery Endpoint:
```
GET /v1/meta/capabilities
```
Returns a list of available features for the authenticated user, e.g.:
```
{
  "capabilities": [
    "mobile_payments",
    "review_system",
    "geolocation_matching"
  ]
}
```
