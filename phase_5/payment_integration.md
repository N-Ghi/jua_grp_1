### **Payment Integration Design**

**a. Map Integration Points with Various Payment Systems**

To serve diverse African markets, the API must integrate with a variety of regional payment gateways and methods:

* **Mobile Money APIs**: M-Pesa (Kenya, Tanzania), MTN Mobile Money (Rwanda, Uganda, Ghana), Airtel Money
* **Bank APIs**: Africa's leading banks (e.g., Ecobank, Equity Bank)
* **International Gateways** (optional for global clients): PayPal, Flutterwave, Stripe (Africa-supported regions)

**Integration Points Example:**

| Provider    | Method             | API Integration Notes                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| M-Pesa      | Mobile Money       | STK push, webhook for confirmation                    |
| MTN MoMo    | Mobile Money       | OAuth2 for token auth, event notification via webhook |
| Flutterwave | Bank Transfer/Card | Unified API for cards, bank, and mobile transactions  |

### **2. Design API Endpoints for Diverse Payment Methods**

Here are sample RESTful API endpoints reflecting resource-oriented principles:

#### **Initiate Payment**

```http
POST /api/payments
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "amount": 50.00,
  "currency": "RWF",
  "payment_method": "mtn_momo",
  "phone_number": "+250788123456",
  "job_id": "789"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_456",
  "status": "pending",
  "provider": "mtn_momo",
  "redirect_url": "https://..."
}
```

---

#### **Verify Payment Status**

```http
GET /api/payments/{transaction_id}/status
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_456",
  "status": "completed",
  "confirmed_at": "2025-05-28T14:00:00Z"
}
```

---

#### **List User Transactions**

```http
GET /api/users/{user_id}/transactions
```

---

### **3. Create Transaction State Management**

Use a clear state model to track payments:

**States:**

* `pending`: Initiated but not confirmed
* `processing`: Awaiting callback or update
* `completed`: Payment successful
* `failed`: Payment unsuccessful
* `refunded`: Amount reversed
* `cancelled`: Aborted by user or system

**Status Flow Diagram (simplified)**:

```
pending → processing → completed
         ↘           ↘
          failed     refunded
                     ↑
                 cancelled
```

### **4. Document Security Considerations for Financial Operations**

Security is paramount when handling financial data and transactions:

* **Authentication & Authorization**

  * Use OAuth2 with scoped tokens for payment actions
  * Ensure only authenticated users can initiate/view transactions

* **Encryption**

  * HTTPS required for all requests
  * Use TLS 1.2+ for secure transmission

* **Webhook Validation**

  * Implement HMAC signatures to verify webhook authenticity
  * Use replay attack protection (timestamps + nonces)

* **Data Protection**

  * Mask or encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., phone numbers)
  * Enforce GDPR and local data laws for user information

* **Audit Logging**

  * Log all financial events (e.g., who initiated, when confirmed)
