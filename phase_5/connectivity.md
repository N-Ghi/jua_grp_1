# Connectivity & Performance Optimization
In many parts of Africa, internet connectivity isn’t always stable, fast, or affordable. That’s why JuaJobs is designed to perform reliably even in challenging network conditions. We’ve made key API design decisions to ensure users—especially those on mobile—get a smooth experience whether they’re in downtown Lagos or a rural village in Uganda.

## Batch Operations
Instead of forcing users to make multiple round trips to the server, we support batching—so apps can send several changes in one go. This reduces network calls and saves battery and data.

Example: Submit multiple job applications in one request

```
POST /v1/applications/batch
```
```
{
  "applications": [
    { "job_id": 101, "worker_id": 55 },
    { "job_id": 102, "worker_id": 55 }
  ]
}
```
We also plan to support bulk updates for worker availability, skill tags, and message acknowledgments.

### Smart Caching
To avoid unnecessary network requests, we use caching where it makes sense:

Static data like skill categories, locations, or service types are cacheable using Cache-Control: max-age=86400.

We encourage apps to cache user profiles and job listings and only revalidate when the user performs a manual refresh.

Support for ETags and If-None-Match headers allows efficient updates without redownloading full responses.

This makes apps feel faster and saves bandwidth.

### Payload Optimization
To keep responses lightweight:

We use sparse fieldsets: clients can request just the fields they need via query parameters.

```
GET /v1/jobs?fields=id,title,location
```

We keep nested resources shallow by default and allow explicit expansion only when needed.

```
GET /v1/jobs/201?expand=client,category
```

We compress all responses using gzip or brotli for clients that support it.

This keeps payloads minimal, even over slow connections.

### Offline-First Capabilities
We want JuaJobs apps to stay functional—even without internet. Here’s how we support offline-first design:

Local caching: apps store job listings, user sessions, and applications locally.

Queue & retry: any action done offline (like applying for a job) gets queued and automatically retried when the connection is restored.

Sync endpoints: special endpoints (like /v1/sync/changes) let the client pull only what’s changed since the last update—great for saving data and syncing quickly.

Offline-first design is especially important for workers on the move or clients in low-bandwidth environments.
